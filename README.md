# Object-Measurement-using-OpenCV
In this project, we measured the dimensions of object in the surrounding like Book, Phone, etc using OpenCV and Aruco Marker.
We actually divided our projrct into two parts :- (1) measuring the dimensions of objects in Image. (2) measuring yhe dimemsions of objects using webcam.
In this, we used the Aruco Marker as a reference to the objects.
So that we don't need to do such complex mathematical operations to measure the dimensions.
In case of image, we can also measure the dimensions of objects without using Aruco Marker but in case of Webcam we must need to use the Aruco Marker to eliminate complex operations.
